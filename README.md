If you are like me, who is bothered by some Chrome extensions that take over your new tab page, slow everything down and cannot get rid of it.
This is the extension that you should use.

When you open a new tab, this extension creates a black-colored blank page. Then you can use the address bar to search and navigate to any website.

There is no extra permission require, it does not read your data.
It is open-sourced on Github. Click homepage to check the code if you are interested in how it works.
